                    ## Session Summary

                    Today, I had a conversation that really made me think about what's been going on in my life lately. I've been feeling pretty down because I recently failed an exam, and my parents weren't too happy about it. They scolded me, which only added to the weight I'm already carrying. The thought of going back to school is daunting, and I find myself not wanting to go at all.

Aside from the pressures at home, I also feel overwhelmed at school. My teacher is pushing me hard, and it's all starting to feel like too much. There's a part of me that just wants to quit because the stress is becoming unbearable. However, talking about it made me realize that maybe I should reach out to someone who can help, like a school counselor or even my teacher. Even though it seems difficult, expressing how I'm feeling might help me find ways to handle the pressure better. This conversation was a small but important step in acknowledging my feelings and considering possible solutions.

                    ## Session Summary

                    In my recent reflection, I've realized how much my emotional state has improved since our last conversation. Previously, I was feeling overwhelmed with school, but now I feel much better. I think a significant factor contributing to this change has been meeting new friends who consistently encourage and support me. Their presence in my life has been uplifting and has helped me navigate the stress and pressure that school often brings.

Having supportive friends has truly made a difference. They have a way of making me feel valued and understood, which has lightened the emotional burden I was carrying. I've been grateful for their encouragement, whether it's through simple gestures or just being there to listen. This experience has taught me the importance of surrounding myself with positive influences and reaching out for support when needed. It feels like a weight has been lifted, and I am more equipped to handle my responsibilities with a clearer mind and a lighter heart.
